This is Yuelin's implementation for HW1

This repository contains 4 directories:
- bit-vector-rank
- bit-vector-select
- wavelet-tree, and
- utils

The first 3 directories contain implementations to the 3 parts
in this homework assignment. The utils directory contains helper
code to measure python object size in bytes (by Raymond Hettinger),
and sample inputs one can use to test the wavelet tree.
